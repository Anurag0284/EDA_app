# EDA Web App

This is a simple **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) web application** built using **Streamlit**. It allows users to upload a dataset (CSV file) and perform basic EDA operations such as viewing data, checking for missing values, generating statistical summaries, and visualizing the data interactively.

## 🧠 Features

- Upload CSV files for analysis  
- Display the first few rows of the dataset  
- View basic information (shape, columns, data types)  
- Summary statistics of the dataset  
- Check for missing/null values  
- Generate interactive plots (histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc.)  
- Correlation heatmap  

## 🚀 Getting Started
